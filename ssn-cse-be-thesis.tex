Students learning to code can immensely benefit from personalized feedback for their specific codes to improve coding standards. However, evaluating the functionality and design quality to give personalized feedback is a very time consuming task for instructors and teaching assistants. Further, design quality is nuanced and is difficult to concisely express as a set of rules. For these reasons, we propose an end-to-end pipeline to both automatically assess the design of a program and provide personalized feedback to guide students on how to make corrections. The model’s effectiveness is evaluated on a corpus of student programs written in Python. The model has an average Mean Absolute Error(MAE) of 1.7 and average Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) of 2.3 when the programs are evaluated out of 10.\end{spacing}
