Feedback is a very essential component of scaffolding for learning as feedback assists students in achieving their learning goals and to improve their self-regulation capability. The findings show that participants were more engaged during the assessment, that the feedback was valuable, and that the explanations were clear and helpful.

Especially with the recent compulsion for online learning due the pandemic, feedback becomes even more critical since instructors and students are separated geographically and physically. In this case, feedback enables the instructor to tailor learning content to the needs of the pupils. Giving feedback, on the other hand, is a difficult chore for instructors, especially in large groups. As a result, numerous automatic feedback systems have been proposed in order to lessen the instructor's effort. 

Grading assignments manually is a very tedious and also a error-prone task. Also since grading is typically done for a large number of student submissions, there is a increased probability of errors. The use of artificial intelligence can be useful to address these issues by automating the grading process, we can assist teachers in the correction and enable students to receive immediate feedback which will help the students to improve their program solutions before their final submission.

Online education in general is less expensive and more affordable than traditional classroom education. There’s also often a wide range of payment options that let you pay in installments or per class. This allows for financially disadvantaged students to upskill themselves to open avenues for better career opportunities. Money can also be saved from the commute and class materials, which are often available for free. In other words, the monetary investment is less, but the results can be comparable to other options. 

Online education enables the student to set their own learning pace, and there’s the added flexibility of setting a schedule that fits everyone’s agenda.As a result, finding a solid work-study balance is easier when the students study online. 

Students of online courses that lack a real-time tutor available can also reap the benefits of feedback with an assisting machine learning based Static Code Analyser that gives personalized feedback to students.
