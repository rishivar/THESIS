\chapter{CONCLUSION}

We proposed a pipeline for grading a student code submission out of 10
which will also provide appropriate feedback to improve the code. The
features were retrieved from both the source code and the AST
representation of the source code. The feature set for each coding
assignment was optimised via feature selection. The initial dataset
created by us was used to train three regressor models such as Support
Vector regressor, Multi Layer Perceptron regressor and Random Forest
Regressor. The Random Forest regressor was shown to be the most
effective for this issue statement. The Random Forest Regressor model
has a MAE of 1.7 and RMSE of 2.3.

Furthermore, depending on the difference between a program's feature
values and the average feature values of ``excellent'' programs, our
model provides personalised feedback.  Whenever a student submits a
code, he will be given feedback instantly to help him improve his
code.  Students can also view the best code submission after the
assignment deadline. The Streamlit framework was used to deploy this
pipeline as a web app.
