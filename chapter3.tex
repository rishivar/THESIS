David Azcona et al. (2019) \cite{A} used program embeddings to profile students based on their code submissions. Around five hundred thousand code submissions of python2 and bash which were collected over three years were used to extract embeddings. They proved that it is hard to cluster students due to the curse of dimensionality. 

J. Walker Orr ,Nathaniel Russell(2021)\cite{T} generated personalised feedback to students to improve the design of their program. The focus was on design quality of programs and not the code's expected functionality. They annotated the student submissions with a design score between 0 and 1 and considered the programs with design score over 0.75 as good programs. Around 40 features were extracted from the code's AST representation. Feedback was generated by comparing the feature vector of a code in question with the average feature vector of good programs.
